        Ripped jeans, gold rings
        All black everything
        Creepin' through the night
        Big girls don't scream
        Heart like Halloween
        Make me feel alive

        They try to put me
        In the corner
        But I don't listen all that much
        Damagin' the neighborhood and
        I've been causin' way too much
        Trouble
        Trouble
        I've been causin' way too much
        Trouble
        Trouble
        I've been causin' way too much

        Same name, won't change
        I'm always game to pick a fight or three
        Hoods up, suits up
        Not sure what's up
        The kids won't play with me

        They try to put me
        In the corner
        But I don't listen all that much
        Damagin' the neighborhood and
        I've been causin' way too much
        Trouble
        Trouble
        I've been causin' way too much
        Trouble
        Trouble
        I've been causin' way too much

        I just wanna live my life the way I wanna live
        I just wanna play with fire
        Burnout with my friends
        We just wanna live our lives the way we wanna live
        We just wanna play with fire burnout with our friends

        Trouble
        Trouble
        I've been causin' way too much
        Trouble
        Trouble
        I've been causin' way too much

        I just wanna live my life the way I wanna live
        I just wanna play with fire burnout with my friends
        We just wanna live our lives the way we wanna live
        We just wanna play with fire burnout with our friends
