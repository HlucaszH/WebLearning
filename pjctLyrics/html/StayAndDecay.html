        You were on the right track
        You were on the right path
        Black door in the forest
        Is it here to taunt us?
        'Cause it's goin' nowhere (ah-ah)
        You gotta move on
        'Cause shadows in the dark
        Are always coming towards you
        Red eyes in the night
        You put 'em outta sight
        Don't be paralyzed, move on to

        Nirvana, or Shangri-La, or Valhalla
        Move, 'cause if you stay in limbo you'll decay

        Roots, trees, branches, leaves
        They're covering the skyline
        Blocking off the sunlight
        Making noon like midnight (ah-ah)
        White horse on the right
        It calls you to the light
        Put it out of sight, you
        Need to try and see
        The forest from the trees
        Don't be paralyzed, move on to

        Nirvana, or Shangri-La, or Valhalla
        Move, 'cause if you stay in limbo you'll decay

        Maybe no one really knows the way
        No one really knows, no one really knows the way
        Broken clocks are right twice a day
        No phone booths, lifelines, not today
        No one really offers help anyway
        No one's there to save you from this place

        Nirvana, or Shangri-La, or Valhalla
        Move, 'cause if you stay in limbo you'll decay
